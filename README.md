# Website-Portfolio

# Purpose

To avail a sample(s) of work from my profolio to potential employers as well as collaborators, web developers and software engineers for public usage. 

# Critera

As a potential employer I need to sample the candidate's previous work

* WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their     work, and how to contact them

* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
* THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
* THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
* THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
* THEN I am taken to that deployed application

* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
* THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
